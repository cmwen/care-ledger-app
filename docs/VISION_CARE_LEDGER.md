# Care Ledger Product Vision

## Product Summary

Care Ledger is a family coordination app that records caregiving efforts between parents and children (in either direction), converts those efforts into agreed credits, and supports transparent payback or reciprocity over time.

The product should reduce manual logging burden by automatically detecting likely care activities and presenting them for periodic review and approval.

Examples of trackable efforts:
- Driving children to and from school
- Laundry and household chores
- Holiday activity planning and execution
- Childcare coverage and pickups
- Emotional or practical support tasks

## Problem Statement

Families do significant caregiving work that is often invisible, untracked, and hard to discuss fairly. This can lead to:
- Perceived imbalance in effort
- Conflict over who contributes more
- Difficulty agreeing on repayment or reciprocity

## Vision

Create a trusted “care bank” where family members can log contributions, agree on credit values, and settle fairly using money, support actions, or other mutually agreed methods.

The core experience is a visual record of care work over time so both parties can quickly see what happened, when, and how it affects balance.

## Mission

Help families reduce conflict and increase fairness by making care work visible, measurable, and negotiable.

## Non-Negotiable Product Principles

1. **Fairness over perfection**: The app should help conversations, not claim absolute truth.
2. **Mutual consent**: Credits and settlements are only valid when both parties agree.
3. **Low friction**: Logging care tasks must take less than 20 seconds.
4. **Automation first**: The app should auto-capture likely activities and ask users to review, not force manual entry for everything.
5. **Privacy by default**: Family data is private and controlled by participants.
6. **Bidirectional care**: Anyone can give care and receive care.
7. **No mandatory central server**: Multi-user sync must work in a serverless/local-first architecture.

## Experience Pillars

- **Visual fairness**: A timeline/dashboard makes care effort visible at a glance.
- **Review over data entry**: Users primarily approve weekly suggestions instead of typing each event.
- **Mutual validation**: Credits become active only after transparent review.

## Target Users (Initial)

- Divorced or separated co-parents coordinating child-related work
- Two-household families needing transparent effort sharing
- Adult children supporting aging parents (and vice versa)

## Core Value Proposition

- Make care work visible
- Convert invisible effort into shared credit records
- Enable low-conflict settlements
- Build trust through shared history

## Success Indicators (Phase 1)

- Weekly active review completion in pilot families
- High percentage of auto-captured events approved with minimal edits
- High percentage of entries reviewed/confirmed by the other party
- Reduced disputes about “who did what” in user feedback
- Repeated use of settlement workflows

## Out of Scope (For MVP)

- Legal arbitration or enforceable contracts
- Public social sharing
- Complex gamification systems
- Full accounting/tax compliance tooling

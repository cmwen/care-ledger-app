# Cross-Project Design Orchestration (Master)

This master plan captures the orchestrated design output across all projects in this workspace.

## Projects Covered

1. Care Ledger app (Flutter)
2. Ollama Toolkit (Flutter module)
3. Astro documentation website

## Role Coverage

Each project design pack includes:
- Product Owner decisions
- Experience Designer decisions
- Researcher recommendations
- Architect implementation plan

## Design Packs

- Care Ledger: [CARE_LEDGER_DESIGN_PACK.md](CARE_LEDGER_DESIGN_PACK.md)
- Ollama Toolkit: [OLLAMA_TOOLKIT_DESIGN_PACK.md](OLLAMA_TOOLKIT_DESIGN_PACK.md)
- Astro Docs: [ASTRO_DOCS_DESIGN_PACK.md](ASTRO_DOCS_DESIGN_PACK.md)

## Existing Source Inputs

The orchestration used these existing repository artifacts as baseline inputs:
- `docs/VISION_CARE_LEDGER.md`
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS_CARE_LEDGER_MVP.md`
- `docs/USER_STORIES_CARE_LEDGER.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP_CARE_LEDGER.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OLLAMA_TOOLKIT.md`
- `docs/OLLAMA_TOOLKIT_SUMMARY.md`
- `astro/README.md`

## Suggested Execution Order

1. Finalize Care Ledger architecture and backlog into implementation tickets.
2. Stabilize Ollama Toolkit contracts and optional UI module roadmap.
3. Rebrand and align Astro docs content with current project identity.

## Done Criteria for “Design Complete”

Design is considered complete for this orchestration pass when:
1. Each project has role-based design decisions documented.
2. MVP/P0 scope and milestones are explicit.
3. Open risks and mitigations are captured.
4. Execution sequence is clear for engineering handoff.
